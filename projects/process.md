## FAQ

#### I have a project that I'm already working on. Can Open Austin endorse my project?

Yes! Follow the steps listed in moving from [experiment to alpha](#experiment-to-alpha).

Also, Open Austin can do more than just endorse your project. We can provide you with:

- Technical resources like Amazon Web Services, Azure, CartoDB, and [many other resources Code for America provides](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/tools/) us with.
- Feedback and user testing.
- Code and technical architecture reviews. 

#### Does my project have to be open source?

All Open Austin projects beyond the experiment stage should be open source. As far as choosing a license, choose whichever one fits your project best. Our projects have used the Unlicense (public domain), the MIT License and the GNU GPL.


#### I have an idea for a project, but don't know how to make it or don't have the time to make it.

Even if you don't have the resources to make your project, you should still tell us about it.

Open an issue at https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas.

#### I don't have a project. How can I help?

Check out the ideas at https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues.

#### I have more questions. Who can I ask?

Email info@open-austin.org or ask on the [Open Austin Slack](http://slack.open-austin.org).


## Project Stages

Open Austin uses four stages of development for projects:

- **Experiment**
- **Alpha**
- **Beta**
- **Official**

### Start an **Experiment**

The **experiment** stage is all about exploring problems/ideas. Open Austin should have plenty of projects at the experiment stage. Most projects will end at this stage, and that's okay.

1. Do something and tell us about it. Open an issue at https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues and tag it with `experiment`.
2. Tell us if you need any resources to get started (AWS hosting, Cartodb, mockup tools, etc.)
3. Come to an [Open Austin event](/events) and share your project

### Experiment to **Alpha**

The **alpha** stage is about making sure your project solves a particular problem.

:information_source:  This is the point at which a project becomes an "approved" Open Austin project.

1. Identify a project owner(s)
2. Get approval from an Open Austin coreteam member
3. Explain
  - What problem the project tries to solve
  - Who the users are
4. List the project on the [Open Austin project page](https://open-austin.org/projects) - [here's] (https://github.com/open-austin/open-austin.github.io/wiki/How-to-Add-a-Project-Page) how
5. Go through a code/architecture review
  - What is the architecture of your project? _We may ask you to make changes to the architecture._
  - How do you deploy the project?

### Alpha to **Beta**
 
The **beta** stage is about getting "more users" and "more feedback." The project should be looking for more users and recording more metrics.

1. You should look for government or community partners, if applicable
2. Start polishing the app
3. Have a sense of what metrics you'll be recording and using to measure impact
4. Plan some launch event

### Beta to **Official**

A project becomes **official** when it's polished, well known, has a community partner, and the project leaders have a good sense of the impact of the project. 

1. Have a launch event! Congratulations, you've done an awesome job, it's time to enjoy your work
2. Have your metrics for usage and impact readily available
